# Euler-Equation-Solver
2-D Euler equation solver using Finite Volume Methods.  
For finite volume formulation, we need to express the Euler Equation in its conservative form.  
* For details on the Flux reconstruction schemes, time integration used please refer to the report.  
* The solver is modularised and each function has its own matlab file. 
* Project_2Fin is to be run to run the solver and generate plots.
* The initial cnditions, scheme used, number of iterations, time integration, fkux reconstruction are to be specified/ modified in the 
input text file.
